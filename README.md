# heatwaveSDG

This package aims to share the data and code for the main results in the manuscript, "Employment disparities among SDG jobs following extreme heatwaves in China".


In the python code baseline.py, variables in the DID analysis are consistently defined.
'rate' represents the ratio between the number of job application records in the corresponding city-level administrative division and the number of nationwide application records at the corresponding period of corresponding heatwave, in percentage terms.
'city_name' represents city-level administrative division dummies.
'city' represents heatwave-defined dataset dummies.
'month_str' and 'week_str' are time dummies.
'wk_flag' represents week relative to the corresponding heatwave event.
'index_flag' represents heatwave dummies for the corresponding treated groups.
